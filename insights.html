        <h2>Insights and Conclusions</h2>
        <h3>Personal Insights:</h3>
        <p>     
            An observation drawn from the survey responses suggests that as women progress further in Track & Field, particularly as they transition into the realm of professionalism, they encounter an increasing number of gender-based challenges.
            This highlights the importance of addressing and mitigating such struggles to create an equitable and supportive environment for women in the sport, fostering their continued success and breaking down barriers as they pursue excellence in their athletic journeys.
        </p>

            An encouraging observation emerges from the survey findings, underscoring a positive aspect worth noting. It appears that the average level of support extended to women in Track & Field at AUB significantly surpasses the support available within the broader context of Lebanon.
            This favorable distinction, as discerned from the comprehensive survey responses and accompanying comments, signals a commendable commitment to fostering an environment that empowers and uplifts female athletes within the AUB community. This disparity emphasizes the potential for AUB to serve as a beacon of progressive support, setting a valuable standard for broader inclusivity and encouragement for women in sports.

            However, despite the commendable level of support for women in Track & Field at AUB, certain systemic challenges persist, reflecting broader issues within the Lebanese sports and athletics community. These challenges include a shortage of resources and funding, a notable disparity in participation rates between women's and men's sports events (attributable not to AUB but to the broader Lebanese sports landscape, as indicated by a well-informed friend of mine involved in various sports).
            Moreover, there's a deficiency in exposure both locally and internationally, with limited presence on platforms like social media. Additionally, there's a notable absence of awareness and education regarding women's unique needs, such as considerations related to menstrual cycles and women's health. Finally, deeply ingrained societal norms and stereotypes, particularly those associated with femininity and masculinity, further contribute to the hurdles faced by women in sports.
            Addressing these multifaceted challenges will be instrumental in fortifying the already positive support environment at AUB and contributing to the broader transformation of women's participation and recognition in sports within Lebanon.

        <h3>A feminist perspective on the situation:</h3>

            In the article <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1080/10413200802575742">"Exploring Women Track and Field Athletes' Meanings of Muscularity"</a>, the authors delve into the subjective interpretations and meanings of muscularity among women in Track and Field.
            The study aims to understand how female athletes perceive and attribute significance to muscularity, shedding light on the nuanced relationship between body image and performance in the sport. 
            For my research, this source provides valuable insights into the psychosocial aspects of women's experiences in Track and Field, offering a perspective on body image that is relevant to my exploration of gender-based challenges and stereotypes in the context of Lebanese female athletes.

            Psychosocial aspects are often deeply intertwined with social and cultural influences. The study investigates how societal and cultural expectations around women's bodies impact the way female athletes perceive and value muscularity. This includes examining stereotypes or norms prevalent in the broader cultural context.
            It also involves understanding the subjective interpretations these athletes have regarding their own bodies in the context of their sport.
            The research investigate how female athletes in Track and Field perceive their own bodies, particularly in terms of muscularity. It explores whether these athletes feel pressured to conform to certain body standards within the context of their sport, and how these perceptions impact their overall body image.
            Understanding the relationship between muscularity and self-esteem is a key aspect of the study. It explores how female athletes who perceive themselves as more muscular experience differences in self-esteem compared to those with different body perceptions.
            This aspect is crucial for understanding the psychological well-being of athletes.

The writer  M. Ann Hall examines the intersection of feminism and sports, emphasizing the relevance of feminist theoretical debates to the fields of sport and physical education. The book advocates for the broader accessibility of feminist ideas to practitioners in sports and physical education. Hall's exploration of various research paradigms underscores the importance of relational research, which considers sports as cultural representations of social relations, including gender.</p>
